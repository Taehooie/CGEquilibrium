# ADMM-Based-Integration
This project aims to mathematically integrate travel demand and traffic network through ADMM. In this experiment, the given network is made of two links, and there are two alternatives (i.e., auto-mode and transit)

- The current version uploaded is handling two-node transportation network with a discrete choice model
